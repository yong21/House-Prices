# House-Prices
I use the Hose Prices dataset from Kaggle Competition. This dataset has 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The train.csv file contains 1460 rows and 80 columns. 

I prepare the data by filling the missing data, cleaning the data and removing the outliers. Then the model is created by using Random Forest, and use this model to train the 70% of dataset. Then use the other 30% of dataset to evaluate the model with the Root Mean Squared Error metric. Last, I tune the parameters of model to get the best result as possible.
